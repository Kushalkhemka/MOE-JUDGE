# Topical Chat

The annotations for the Persona Chat dataset were introduced in
[this](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.64/) paper. The annotation instructions were very
long and detailed. We provide a ```long``` and a ```short``` converted version. The ```long
version``` contains the full set of instructions, whereas the ```short``` version contains only the
construct-specific question.
