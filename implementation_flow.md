# Implementation Plan: MoE-Judge (Symbolic Mixture-of-Experts for LLM-as-a-Judge)

## 1. Requirements & Problem Definition
- **Goal:** Build a modular, multi-dimensional, bias-aware LLM-as-a-Judge system using a Symbolic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.
- **Key Features:**
  - Dynamic skill-based routing of evaluation tasks to specialized LLM agents.
  - Dynamic extraction of evaluation criteria (policies) and weights per instance.
  - Robust bias mitigation (permutation, masking, panel aggregation).
  - Multimodal (text/image) support.
  - Adaptive feedback and synthetic data generation for self-improvement.
- **Inputs:** Model outputs to be judged (text, optionally images), task metadata, ground truth (if available).
- **Outputs:** Multi-dimensional, interpretable evaluation scores/annotations, bias-mitigated judgments, and optionally, synthetic benchmark data.

## 2. High-Level Architecture
- **Scenario/Instance Generator:** (from IntellAgent)
  - Generates diverse, realistic evaluation scenarios (text, image, multimodal) and edge cases.
- **Policy Extractor:** (new, inspired by IntellAgent's policy graph)
  - Uses an LLM to extract relevant evaluation criteria and their weights for each instance.
- **Skill Annotator:** (from Symbolic-MoE)
  - Annotates each instance with required skills/dimensions (e.g., factuality, safety, clarity).
- **Expert Pool:** (from Symbolic-MoE, extended)
  - A set of LLMs/agents, each specialized in one or more evaluation skills/dimensions.
- **Expert Recruiter/Router:** (from Symbolic-MoE)
  - Dynamically selects the best experts for each instance based on annotated skills and policies.
- **Simulation Engine:** (from IntellAgent)
  - Simulates user-agent interactions and stress-tests the evaluation pipeline.
- **Judgment Aggregator:** (from Symbolic-MoE, extended)
  - Aggregates expert outputs using bias mitigation (permutation, masking, panel voting).
- **Feedback Loop & Synthetic Data Generator:** (from IntellAgent)
  - Analyzes failures, generates new scenarios, and updates benchmarks.
- **Visualization & Analytics:** (from IntellAgent)
  - Dashboards for results, bias analysis, and system diagnostics.

## 3. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Environment Setup & Baseline Integration
1. **Set up a unified Python environment** (Python 3.10+, CUDA, all dependencies from both projects).
2. **Clone and install both Symbolic-MoE and IntellAgent** in a shared workspace.
3. **Verify GPU/LLM access** (local or API-based) for all required models.
4. **Run baseline scripts** from both projects to ensure functionality (e.g., scenario generation, agent inference, aggregation, simulation).

### Phase 2: Scenario & Policy Generation
5. **Leverage IntellAgent’s scenario generator** to create a diverse set of evaluation tasks (text, image, multimodal, edge cases).
6. **Extend scenario generator** to output metadata needed for MoE routing (e.g., task type, context, expected skills).
7. **Implement a Policy Extractor module:**
   - Use an LLM to analyze each scenario and extract a list of relevant evaluation criteria (e.g., factuality, safety, clarity, coherence, multimodal alignment) and assign weights.
   - Store extracted policies alongside each scenario instance.

### Phase 3: Skill Annotation & Expert Pool Construction
8. **Adapt Symbolic-MoE’s skill annotation pipeline** to label each scenario with required skills/dimensions, using the extracted policies.
9. **Build/curate an expert pool:**
   - For each skill/dimension, select or fine-tune LLMs/agents (from agent_map in Symbolic-MoE) that excel at that evaluation (e.g., factuality judge, safety judge, multimodal judge).
   - Optionally, include human-in-the-loop or rule-based experts for certain dimensions.
10. **Document each expert’s profile** (capabilities, known biases, strengths, weaknesses).

### Phase 4: Dynamic Expert Recruitment & Routing
11. **Implement the expert recruiter/router:**
    - For each scenario, use the annotated skills and policy weights to select the top-k experts for each dimension.
    - Route the evaluation task to the selected experts, passing all necessary context and instructions.
    - Ensure modularity so new experts can be added easily.

### Phase 5: Simulation & Evaluation Pipeline
12. **Integrate IntellAgent’s simulation engine** to:
    - Simulate user-agent interactions for each scenario, including edge cases and adversarial prompts.
    - Collect expert judgments for each simulated interaction.
13. **Implement the judgment aggregator:**
    - Aggregate expert outputs using majority voting, weighted voting (by policy weights), or more advanced methods (e.g., Dawid-Skene, panel consensus).
    - Apply bias mitigation: randomize response order, mask agent identities, and use a panel of judges for second-order review.
    - Output a multi-dimensional, interpretable judgment for each instance.

### Phase 6: Feedback Loop & Self-Improvement
14. **Analyze system failures and biases:**
    - Use analytics from IntellAgent to identify common failure modes, bias patterns, and underrepresented scenarios.
15. **Generate synthetic data:**
    - Use the system itself to create new, challenging scenarios targeting weaknesses.
    - Add these to the scenario pool for future evaluation.
16. **Iteratively retrain/update expert pool** (if using fine-tuned models) and update policy extraction as new evaluation needs emerge.

### Phase 7: Visualization, Analytics, and Benchmarking
17. **Integrate IntellAgent’s visualization tools** (e.g., Streamlit dashboards) to:
    - Display evaluation results, bias metrics, expert agreement, and scenario coverage.
    - Allow interactive exploration of system performance and failure cases.
18. **Benchmark MoE-Judge against monolithic LLM-as-a-Judge baselines** (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) on standard and synthetic datasets.
    - Report improvements in fairness, reliability, and multi-dimensionality.

### Phase 8: Documentation, Testing, and Release
19. **Document all modules, APIs, and configuration options.**
20. **Write unit and integration tests** for each major component (scenario generation, policy extraction, expert routing, aggregation, analytics).
21. **Release code and documentation** (open-source, with example configs and datasets).

## 4. Module Mapping & Integration Advice
- **Scenario Generation:** Use IntellAgent’s dataset/event/simulation modules. Extend to output MoE-relevant metadata.
- **Policy Extraction:** New module, can use LLM prompting (e.g., GPT-4) to extract criteria/weights per instance.
- **Skill Annotation:** Adapt Symbolic-MoE’s keyword/skill annotation scripts.
- **Expert Pool:** Use Symbolic-MoE’s agent_map and extend with new LLMs or multimodal evaluators.
- **Recruitment/Routing:** Adapt Symbolic-MoE’s recruit_agents.py for dynamic, policy-weighted selection.
- **Simulation:** Use IntellAgent’s dialog and event simulation for stress-testing and data generation.
- **Aggregation:** Use and extend Symbolic-MoE’s aggregation logic, adding bias mitigation and panel review.
- **Analytics/Visualization:** Use IntellAgent’s Streamlit dashboards and analytics modules.

## 5. Practical Tips & Considerations
- **Start with text-only scenarios, then add multimodal support.**
- **Use API-based LLMs for rapid prototyping; switch to local models for scale/cost.**
- **Carefully log all decisions, agent outputs, and aggregation steps for transparency.**
- **Automate as much of the pipeline as possible, but allow for human-in-the-loop overrides.**
- **Continuously monitor for new biases and update mitigation strategies.**
- **Engage with the research community for feedback and benchmarking.**
